Look how many stories there are of people losing years and years to something that they now regret. The realization is that this is the norm, not the exception. We\u0026rsquo;re all just fragile and fallible and trying to make our way through life as best we can, and we all end up messing up big somewhere along the way.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s easy to look back on 10 wasted years and think you failed, you blew your one chance at life.
