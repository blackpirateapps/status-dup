"The new atheists share with the religious fundamentalists the belief that their way of seeing the world is the only way there is. Now science is a valid way of seeing the universe, religion is a valid way of seeing the universe and they have the difference  between prose and poetry. So anyone who thinks only prose exists or we only need poetry is a fundamentalist because they fail to understand the many ways in which we have to interpret the universe in order to live a meaningful life."
