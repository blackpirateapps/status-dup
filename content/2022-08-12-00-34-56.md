Right now I use dropbox to sync my obsidian notes. It is not perfect but it is okay and works very well. But I am thinking if switiching to github for storage of my all notes would be a good idea. I think yes, beacuse git is very good at small text files or images. Maybe I would move to it someday. This microblog already lives on github so why not all my personal notes?
