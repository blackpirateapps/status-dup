>“Those who cannot remember the past are
condemned to repeat it.” But equally dangerous
are those who remember the past only to relive it,
seeking justice through reversal, not
reconciliation. The greatest service we can do to
history is not to rewrite it, but to learn from it —
with humility, not hubris.
